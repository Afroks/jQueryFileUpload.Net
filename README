A very basic framework around jQueryFileUpload scripts, to host in ASP.Net.

TODO:
=====
 - Decouple UI from upload handers & templates a bit more? (less hooks by structure, more by class)
 - Ability to add placeholders for required dependencies (like the components of a .ism file)
 - Callbacks for current status (for post-upload processing, like transcodes)
 - Section divisions by classifications (different targets, like documents, videos etc)
 - Look at http://sandbox.knarly.com/js/dropfiles/ for IE9 file drop?
