TODO:
=====
 - Ability to add placeholders for required dependencies (like the components of a .ism file)
 - Callbacks for current status (for post-upload processing, like transcodes)
 - Section divisions by classifications (different targets, like documents, videos etc)
 - Look at http://html5doctor.com/native-drag-and-drop/ for IE9 file drop?
